why ?
	interfaces used to create loosely coupled, extensible and testable code.
	used to achieve abstraction
	used to achieve multiple inheritance
	
	used in dependency injection (coding agains interface)
		constructor injection
		setter injection
		method injection
	
what ?
	interface in java is a contract for other classes to implement, is a type that containes abstract methods and static constants.
	An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.

how ?
	one class can implement several interfaces 
	an interface can implement another interface
